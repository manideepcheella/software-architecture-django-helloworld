# Hello World Django App

This is a simple Django app that provides a Hello World message through a JSON response.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Django installed on your machine. If not, you can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install django
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HelloWorldProject.git
cd HelloWorldProject
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install project dependencies:

```bash
pip install django
```

### Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000/hello/](http://localhost:8000/hello/) in your web browser, and you should see the JSON response:

```json
{"Message": "Hello World!"}
```
